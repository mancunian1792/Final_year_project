1.PCA folder contains downsampled data that is to be used for PCA program.
2.COntains 2 dataset .Train dataset is labelled as data and test dataset is labelled as test.
3.Run the HarishPCA.m directly with these two datasets.


Note: The RBF-NN and the PCA are to be stored in different folders and run separately as they \
both have a similar datset name called data.mat



1.Run blaine.m to execute the RBF-NN using ROLS.
2.The ROLS program is coded in batchols1.m .Although the recursive part is left out.The program can 
run with normal OLS itself.
